        "description": "Protocols: KPC mice, first described by (Hingorani et al., 2005), were bred in house on a mixed background. Mice were genotyped by Transnetyx (Cordoba, TN, USA). Mice were monitored at least 3 times weekly and abdominal palpation carried out to detect pancreatic cancer. For drug treatments, adult mice of both sexes were randomly assigned to cohorts. Treatments used were: vehicle (0.1 % Tween80/0.5 % methylcellulose) p.o. twice daily, CSF-1R small molecule inhibitor (AstraZeneca, AZD7507) at 100mg/Kg p.o. twice daily; CXCR2 small molecule inhibitor (AstraZeneca, AZD5069) at 100mg/Kg p.o. twice daily, or AZD7507 and AZD5069 in combination, both at 100mg/Kg p.o. twice daily. PDAC harvested from mice into RNAl8r, then stored at -80C RNAeasy mini kit, then Turbo DNAse Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep Kit",
